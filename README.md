# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Module20 Neural Networks
## Overview
---
Fot this assignment, I will create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. I will use a CSV that contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup business over the years. There are three technical analysis deliverables as follows:

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model


## Results
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
## Summary
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (30 points)
